            <template>The Host ID is used to determine the host within any network. The Host ID is assigned based on the following rules:

The Host ID must be unique within any network.
The Host ID in which all the bits are set to 0 cannot be assigned as it is used to represent the network ID of the IP address.
The Host ID in which all the bits are set to 1 cannot be assigned as it is reserved for the multicast address.

            <template>If the hosts are located within the same local network, then they are assigned with the same network ID. The following are the rules for assigning Network ID:

The network ID cannot start with 127 as 127 is used by Class A.
The Network ID in which all the bits are set to 0 cannot be assigned as it is used to specify a particular host on the local network.
The Network ID in which all the bits are set to 1 cannot be assigned as it is reserved for the multicast address.

Any reliability factor can be considered for the assignment of reliability ratings, which are generally numeric values assigned by the system administrator.

It is a technique in which the administrator manually adds the routes in a routing table.
A Router can send the packets for the destination along the route defined by the administrator.
In this technique, routing decisions are not made based on the condition or topology of the networks

            <template>Default Routing is a technique in which a router is configured to send all the packets to the same hop device, and it doesn't matter whether it belongs to a particular network or not. A Packet is transmitted to the device for which it is configured in default routing.
Default Routing is used when networks deal with the single exit point.
It is also useful when the bulk of transmission networks have to transmit the data to the same hp device.
When a specific route is mentioned in the routing table, the router will choose the specific route rather than the default route. The default route is chosen only when a specific route is not mentioned in the routing table.

            <template>It is also known as Adaptive Routing.
It is a technique in which a router adds a new route in the routing table for each packet in response to the changes in the condition or topology of the network.
Dynamic protocols are used to discover the new routes to reach the destination.
In Dynamic Routing, RIP and OSPF are the protocols used to discover the new routes.
If any route goes down, then the automatic adjustment will be made to reach the destination.

It is used to associate an IP address with the MAC address.
Each device on the network is recognized by the MAC address imprinted on the NIC. Therefore, we can say that devices need the MAC address for communication on a local area network. MAC address can be changed easily. For example, if the NIC on a particular machine fails, the MAC address changes but IP address does not change. ARP is used to find the MAC address of the node when an internet address is known.

If the host wants to know its IP address, then it broadcast the RARP query packet that contains its physical address to the entire network. A RARP server on the network recognizes the RARP packet and responds back with the host IP address.
The protocol which is used to obtain the IP address from a server is known as Reverse Address Resolution Protocol.
The message format of the RARP protocol is similar to the ARP protocol.
Like ARP frame, RARP frame is sent from one machine to another encapsulated in the data portion of a frame.

            <pattern>ICMP</pattern>
            <template>ICMP stands for Internet Control Message Protocol.
The ICMP is a network layer protocol used by hosts and routers to send the notifications of IP datagram problems back to the sender.
ICMP uses echo test/reply to check whether the destination is reachable and responding.
ICMP handles both control and error messages, but its main function is to report the error but not to correct them.
An IP datagram contains the addresses of both source and destination, but it does not know the address of the previous router through which it has been passed. Due to this reason, ICMP can only send the messages to the source, but not to the immediate routers.
ICMP protocol communicates the error messages to the sender. ICMP messages cause the errors to be returned back to the user processes.
ICMP messages are transmitted within IP datagram.

            <template>IGMP stands for Internet Group Message Protocol.
The IP protocol supports two types of communication:
Unicasting: It is a communication between one sender and one receiver. Therefore, we can say that it is one-to-one communication.
Multicasting: Sometimes the sender wants to send the same message to a large number of receivers simultaneously. This process is known as multicasting which has one-to-many communication.
The IGMP protocol is used by the hosts and router to support multicasting.
The IGMP protocol is used by the hosts and router to identify the hosts in a LAN that are the members of a group.
