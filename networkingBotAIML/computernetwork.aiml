Peer-To-Peer network is useful for small environments, usually up to 10 computers. Peer-To-Peer network has no dedicated server. Special permissions are assigned to each computer for sharing the resources, but this can lead to a problem if the computer with the resource is down.

          <pattern>ClientServer network</pattern>
          <template>Client/Server network is a network model designed for the end users called clients, to access the resources such as songs, video, etc. from a central computer known as Server. The central controller is known as a server while all other computers in the network are called clients.A server performs all the major operations such as security and network management. A server is responsible for managing all the resources such as files, directories, printer, etc. All the clients communicate with each other through a server. For example, if client1 wants to send some data to client 2, then it first sends the request to the server for the permission. The server sends the response to the client 1 to initiate its communication with the client 2.

          <template>A Hub is a hardware device that divides the network connection among multiple devices. When computer requests for some information from a network, it first sends the request to the Hub through cable. Hub will broadcast this request to the entire network. All the devices will check whether the request belongs to them or not. If not, the request will be dropped. The process used by the Hub consumes more bandwidth and limits the amount of communication. Nowadays, the use of hub is obsolete, and it is replaced by more advanced computer network components such as Switches, Routers.

          <template>A switch is a hardware device that connects multiple devices on a computer network. A Switch contains more advanced features than Hub. The Switch contains the updated table that decides where the data is transmitted or not. Switch delivers the message to the correct destination based on the physical address present in the incoming message. A Switch does not broadcast the message to the entire network like the Hub. It determines the device to whom the message is to be transmitted. Therefore, we can say that switch provides a direct connection between the source and destination. It increases the speed of the network.

                A router works in a Layer 3 (Network layer) of the OSI Reference model.
                A router forwards the packet based on the information available in the routing table.
                It determines the best path from the available paths for the transmission of the packet.

          <pattern>Bus Topology</pattern>
          <template>The bus topology is designed in such a way that all the stations are connected through a single cable known as a backbone cable. Each node is either connected to the backbone cable by drop cable or directly connected to the backbone cable. When a node wants to send a message over the network, it puts a message over the network. All the stations available in the network will receive the message whether it has been addressed or not. The bus topology is mainly used in 802.3 (ethernet) and 802.4 standard networks. The configuration of a bus topology is quite simpler as compared to other topologies. The backbone cable is considered as a "single lane" through which the message is broadcast to all the stations. The most common access method of the bus topologies is CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access).

          <pattern>Ring Topology</pattern>
          <template>Ring topology is like a bus topology, but with connected ends.
The node that receives the message from the previous computer will retransmit to the next node.
The data flows in one direction, i.e., it is unidirectional.
The data flows in a single loop continuously known as an endless loop.
It has no terminated ends, i.e., each node is connected to other node and having no termination point.
The data in a ring topology flow in a clockwise direction.
The most common access method of the ring topology is token passing.
Token passing: It is a network access method in which token is passed from one node to another node.
Token: It is a frame that circulates around the network.

          <pattern>Star Topology</pattern>
          <template>Star topology is an arrangement of the network in which every node is connected to the central hub, switch or a central computer.
The central computer is known as a server, and the peripheral devices attached to the server are known as clients.
Coaxial cable or RJ-45 cables are used to connect the computers.
Hubs or Switches are mainly used as connection devices in a physical star topology.
Star topology is the most popular topology in network implementation.

          <pattern>Tree topology</pattern>
          <template>Tree topology combines the characteristics of bus topology and star topology.
A tree topology is a type of structure in which all the computers are connected with each other in hierarchical fashion.
The top-most node in tree topology is known as a root node, and all other nodes are the descendants of the root node.
There is only one path exists between two nodes for the data transmission. Thus, it forms a parent-child hierarchy.

          <pattern>Mesh topology</pattern>
          <template>Mesh technology is an arrangement of the network in which computers are interconnected with each other through various redundant connections.
There are multiple paths from one computer to another computer.
It does not contain the switch, hub or any central computer which acts as a central point of communication.
The Internet is an example of the mesh topology.
Mesh topology is mainly used for WAN implementations where communication failures are a critical concern.
Mesh topology is mainly used for wireless networks.
Mesh topology can be formed by using the formula:
Number of cables = (n*(n-1))/2;

          <pattern>Hybrid Topology</pattern>
          <template>The combination of various different topologies is known as Hybrid topology.
A Hybrid topology is a connection between different links and nodes to transfer the data.
When two or more different topologies are combined together is termed as Hybrid topology and if similar topologies are connected with each other will not result in Hybrid topology. For example, if there exist a ring topology in one branch of ICICI bank and bus topology in another branch of ICICI bank, connecting these two topologies will result in Hybrid topology.

          <pattern>Simplex mode</pattern>
          <template>In Simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, i.e., the data flow in one direction. A device can only send the data but cannot receive it or it can receive the data but cannot send the data. This transmission mode is not very popular as mainly communications require the two-way exchange of data. The simplex mode is used in the business field as in sales that do not require any corresponding reply. The radio station is a simplex channel as it transmits the signal to the listeners but never allows them to transmit back. Keyboard and Monitor are the examples of the simplex mode as a keyboard can only accept the data from the user and monitor can only be used to display the data on the screen. The main advantage of the simplex mode is that the full capacity of the communication channel can be utilized during transmission.

          <pattern>Halfduplex mode</pattern>
          <template>In a Half-duplex channel, direction can be reversed, i.e., the station can transmit and receive the data as well. Messages flow in both the directions, but not at the same time. The entire bandwidth of the communication channel is utilized in one direction at a time. In half-duplex mode, it is possible to perform the error detection, and if any error occurs, then the receiver requests the sender to retransmit the data. A Walkie-talkie is an example of the Half-duplex mode. In Walkie-talkie, one party speaks, and another party listens. After a pause, the other speaks and first party listens. Speaking simultaneously will create the distorted sound which cannot be understood.

          <pattern>Fullduplex mode</pattern>
          <template>In Full duplex mode, the communication is bi-directional, i.e., the data flow in both the directions.
Both the stations can send and receive the message simultaneously.
Full-duplex mode has two simplex channels. One channel has traffic moving in one direction, and another channel has traffic flowing in the opposite direction.
The Full-duplex mode is the fastest mode of communication between devices.
The most common example of the full-duplex mode is a telephone network. When two people are communicating with each other by a telephone line, both can talk and listen at the same time.
